# Data Security & Governance

As a **Legacy Microsoft Partner (2012)**, I architected this CRM with a security-first approach:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** UI views and data access are restricted based on User Roles (Admin, Manager, Field Crew).
2. **Audit Logging:** Every data change is timestamped and attributed to a specific user for accountability.
3. **Data Residency:** Leveraging AppSheet’s secure cloud environment ensures compliance with standard data protection protocols.
